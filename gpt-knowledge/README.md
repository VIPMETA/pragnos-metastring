This directory stores encrypted synchronization payloads that align the PragnOS MetaSystem with partner AI models.

> ⚠️ **Security Notice:** Only commit redacted or encrypted artifacts. Plaintext exports must never be added to version control.

## Integration Workflow

2. Encrypt the archive with the shared custodial key ring.
3. Store the encrypted artifact here alongside checksum metadata.
4. Submit the decryption manifest through the governance portal.
